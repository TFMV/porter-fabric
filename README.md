# Porter Fabric

**Fast. Secure. Local-first.**

Porter Fabric is a high-performance data fabric built for the next era of analytics infrastructure. It combines speed, simplicity, and security—without the overhead of traditional data platforms.

- Sub-millisecond query startup
- Embedded Flight SQL server
- End-to-end encryption
- Modular backend support (DuckDB, ClickHouse, and more)

> "What if the fastest way to move data...was not to move it at all?"

Porter Fabric is built for developers, architects, and infra teams who want *clean boundaries, instant answers,* and *no orchestration theater*. It's designed to disappear into your stack while unlocking local-first analytics at scale.
